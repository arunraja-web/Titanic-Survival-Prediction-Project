🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes passenger details such as age, gender, class, fare, and family information. The goal is to analyze these features, perform data preprocessing, and build a predictive model that accurately classifies survival outcomes.

The project involves data cleaning (handling missing values and encoding categorical variables), exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify survival patterns, and feature selection to improve model performance. Multiple machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest were implemented and evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix metrics.

This project helped me gain hands-on experience in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.
